# NTXOpenChallenge2018_NeuroControl
Project submitted as Open Challenge at the NeuroTechX Competition 2018


SyanpsETS is proud to present the NeuroControl project as part of the Open Challenge for the NeuroTechX 2018 Competition. This project is meant to be a building block for everyone who want to integrate biosignals to control software and robotics. As such, NeuroControl integrates bio-inputs of 2-players, using 2 Interaxon Muse 2014 for EEG and 2 Myo Armband for EMG. Those inputs are gathered in a digital environment using the Unity3D game engine, and custom triggers are sent to control robotics using Arduino Uno via a python script. Our chosen robotics for this project have been the InMoov 3D printed robotic hand as well as a vibration module meant for haptic feedback.
